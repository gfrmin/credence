# Fractional / soft-evidence Bernoulli. The observation is a pair
# `(outcome, weight)` with `weight ∈ [0,1]` (e.g. a category posterior
# π_c); the conjugate update credits `weight` pseudo-counts:
# `α += weight·outcome, β += weight·(1-outcome)`. The strict unit-count
# `BetaBernoulli` above is left untouched (it still errors on non-{0,1}).
# Rationale + worked example: docs/paper1/move-2c-design.md.
struct WeightedBernoulli <: LeafFamily end
# Virtual / soft EVIDENCE on a latent Bernoulli. The observation is a pair
# `(r, w)` of likelihoods `r = P(evidence | θ-event true)`,
# `w = P(evidence | θ-event false)` — Pearl's λ-message, not an outcome. The
# exact posterior under `L(θ) = r·θ + w·(1−θ)` is a 2-component Beta mixture;
# the conjugate `update` here is its MEAN-EXACT ADF collapse:
#   π = r·θ̄ / (r·θ̄ + w·(1−θ̄)),   α += π,  β += (1−π)    (θ̄ = α/(α+β))
# which reproduces the exact posterior mean (α+π)/(α+β+1) — so any decision
# reading E[θ] is exact; only the belief's variance is approximated. The
# predictive marginal `r·E[θ] + w·(1−E[θ])` (the BMA structure-reweight term)
# is supplied by the kernel's `log_density`. Reduces EXACTLY to BetaBernoulli
# at `(r,w) = (1,0)` (a hard 1) and `(0,1)` (a hard 0). Distinct from
# WeightedBernoulli, which tempers a KNOWN outcome by a weight; SoftBernoulli
# carries the likelihood of an indirect signal and decodes per-cell.

# Group-noisy-channel likelihood: a DOCUMENT of `m` correlated chunk-extractions of one
# source, read as evidence about a categorical hypothesis `V` (which candidate is the truth,
# or NONE). The m chunks share the document's content via a binary document latent
# `D_d ∈ {reliable, noise}` with `P(reliable) = r_d = ρ·covariate`; given `D_d` the chunks are
# conditionally independent. Marginalising `D_d` analytically (no hypothesis growth) gives the
# exact per-document group-likelihood
#     P(reports | V=j) = r_d·1{all m chunks reported j} + (1−r_d)·(1/A)^m
# — a reliable document reports the truth in every chunk; a noise document reports each chunk
# uniformly over the `A` alternatives. This is the EXACT correlated-evidence model the §4.2
# "tempering" (raising each chunk's log-likelihood to a power) crudely approximated:
# corroborating chunks of ONE document move the posterior LESS than the same number of
# INDEPENDENT documents (likelihood-ratio `1 + r_d·Aᵐ/(1−r_d)` ≪ the independent
# `[1 + r_d·A/(1−r_d)]ᵐ`), with no β-knob. At `m=1` it reduces bit-for-bit to the single-obs
# noisy channel (match `r_d+(1−r_d)/A`, miss `(1−r_d)/A`). NONE and any non-reported candidate
# are explained only by the noise channel (all_match false ⇒ reliable term vanishes),
# recovering the "the truth is not among the retrieved ⇒ every report is a misread" semantics.
#
# `covariate` is the document's ρ-free reliability factor (authority·subject·time); `rho` is
# the shared extractor reliability ρ (a scalar here; carried + marginalised as a latent across
